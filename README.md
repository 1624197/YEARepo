Terms of Use
Any original material made by Yanfly on Yanfly Channel is free for use with both free and commercial RPG Maker games. I don’t demand royalties or special liberties if you choose to use the original content in your commercial games (but a free copy of your game would be nice~).

Editing these scripts is perfectly okay as long as you still provide the proper credit. Any non-original content posted, linked, or shared on Yanfly Channel will require you to contact the respective parties for permission of use.

I think this is simple. I’d like to keep it simple. Please don’t do things that’ll make me complicate it.
